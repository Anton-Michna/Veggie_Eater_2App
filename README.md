# Veggie_Eater_2App

This was a fun project that allowed me to learn more about how to use Swift and SwiftUI which I previously knew little to nothing about. My friends and I
threw around dumb ideas for an app to make for a while and this was the one that really stuck as something I thought I would enjoy making. My interest in 
app development has increased greatly after completing this project as it is the most real example that I have seen in that area so far in my career.
